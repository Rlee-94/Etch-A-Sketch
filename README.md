## Built with

- MacOS terminal
- Git and GitHub

## Outcome

- Used HTML5 for better readability and structure.
- Used CSS for styling.
- Used Javascript for functionality
- Used **Git** and **GitHub** for project management.
- Tried to maintain **clean code**.
- **Cross tested** on Firefox and Chromium based browsers.

## Summary

This was a very difficult project for me and it took me quite a lot of trial and error to get the functionaility working. This project allows users to switch between black and color drawing on the board. You can toggle the coloring on/off with a mouse click. You can also change the size of the board to allow for a thicker or thinner color line.

### What I learned

- Gained a better understanding of **HTML** and **CSS** and Javascript foundations.
- Improved the ability to use click events for functionaility
- Improved **code structure** and **code readability**.
- Improved **clean code** writing.
- Improved CSS techniques by using gradient background and creating etch a sketch board
